   // abstraction is defined as something that exist in theory but not in reality
    //abstract method has no body and only signature of the method is defined and not designed to run as is
    //designed to be overriden by the subclass.
    // abstract class can also take implemented method.
    //you cannot instantiate an abstract class. they are meant to be used as a template not meant to be used as is.
    //in otherwords, you cannot create an object of the abstract class.
    //you can use an abstarct class as a type but would have to instantiate it with one of its subclasses.
    //for example if you have an abstract class Shape and a subclass rectangle, to instantiate in main, you will do
    // Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();
